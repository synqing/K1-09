Relevance / Audience
- QA, validation, and feature owners.

Inputs

Plan
1) Metrics & fixtures: what to measure and with what.
2) Build a small battery: sanity, stress, regression.
3) Add automation hooks or scripts.
4) Define pass/fail gating and report format.

Action Plan
- Draft test matrix with IDs; map to scenarios and KPIs.
- Provide scripts/commands and sample logs.

Deliverables
- Test matrix; scripts; sample pass report; gating criteria.

Risks & Mitigations
