# Manufacturing Readiness & Supply Chain

Goal
- Freeze a buildable BOM for {qty} with alternates and test coverage.

Relevance / Audience
- Operations, supply chain, and test engineering.

Inputs
- Current BOM, lead time/MOQ targets, factory/test constraints.

Plan
1) Risk parts: lifecycle, lead time, MOQ, pricing.
2) Alternates: footprint‑compatible, performance‑equivalent.
3) Golden sample and incoming QA procedures.
4) Test jig HW/SW outline (fixture IO, scripts, thresholds).

Action Plan
- Build alternates matrix; link datasheets.
- Define FA/RA acceptance and documentation.
- Draft tester scripts and fixture pinout.

Deliverables
- MRL checklist; alternates table; test‑coverage map; handoff pack.

Risks & Mitigations
- Obsolescence: multiple sources; last‑time‑buy triggers.
- Yield drift: SPC charts; periodic calibration.
