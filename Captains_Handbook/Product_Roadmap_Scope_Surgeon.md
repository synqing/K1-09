# Product Roadmap & Scope Surgeon

Goal
- Cut to a shippable thin slice for {milestone/date}.

Relevance / Audience
- Founders, PM/EM, cross‑functional leads.

Inputs
- Must‑haves vs nice‑to‑haves, constraints, dependencies.

Plan
1) Slice by user outcome; stage risky components earlier.
2) Map dependencies and exit criteria per slice.
3) Align dates/resources; time‑box experiments.

Action Plan
- Produce 3–5 milestone slices with acceptance.
- Note tradeoffs and what gets cut if needed.

Deliverables
- Milestone plan; risk burndown; decision tradeoffs.

Risks & Mitigations
- Scope creep: lock acceptance; require ADR for scope changes.
