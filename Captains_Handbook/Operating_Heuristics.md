# Operating Heuristics

- Instrument before you optimize; prove with data.
- Slice problems into verifiable steps; pause between steps to confirm.
- Prefer toggles + reversible changes under time pressure.
- Always leave behind docs, toggles, and a “how to verify” section.
- Keep cognitive load low: fewer, better messages with real evidence.
- Reference exact file paths and lines when explaining changes.
