### Overview
- Pick the prompt that fits the task and paste it as the agent’s instruction.
- Add your context under Inputs; insist on a short plan before execution.
- Method: Diagnose → Instrument → Plan → Implement → Verify → Document → Next steps.
- Deliverables: minimal diffs, clear evidence (logs/screens/tests), crisp summary, ready‑to‑paste commit message.

### Quick Start
1) Choose one primary prompt (+ optional secondary, e.g., Optimizer + Validation).
2) Paste the prompt and fill Inputs: `{repo/links}`, `{constraints}`, `{acceptance criteria}`.
3) Require: plan (3–6 steps), instrumentation, minimal diffs, verification, commit text.

### Rituals
- Daily Command Center: one outcome; top 3 blocks → next measurable step; metrics/logs to confirm; fastest unblockers.
- Weekly Review: shipped/learned/blocked; risks added/retired; KPI movement; next week’s one‑pager and commitments.

### Operating Heuristics
- Instrument before you optimize; prove with data.
- Slice problems into verifiable steps; pause to confirm.
- Prefer toggles and reversible changes under time pressure.
- Always leave behind docs, toggles, and “how to verify”.
- Keep cognitive load low: fewer, better messages with evidence.

Operating Heuristics

Instrument before you optimize; prove with data.

Prefer toggles + reversible changes under time pressure.
Always leave behind docs, toggles, and a “how to verify” section.
Keep cognitive load low: fewer, better messages with real evidence.

Commit Message Scaffold
feat({area}): {concise outcome}

what changed and why (bullet points; minimal, specific)
problems solved (evidence)
lessons learned (1–3)
recommendations/next steps
Example:
feat(audio/tempo): retune novelty + resolver for high-tempo tracking

added HM history + dual ACF (mix/HM) to surface fast pulses
rebalanced weights + per‑band medians so HM onsets survive
resolver now blends phase (low/HM), adds sticky bias, and seeds from HM peak when close
diagnostics expanded (toggles + lane scores)
Problems solved: stuck at slow harmonic (85–90 BPM), no visibility
Lessons: seeding and medians dominate outcomes
Next: sweep HM weight/medians; lock promotion thresholds with candidate logs
Diagnostic‑First Rubric

What’s the smallest thing to measure to validate the hypothesis?
Can we toggle it at runtime to compare A/B?
What one line of telemetry will tell a stranger what’s happening?
If you want a JSON index for programmatic use, here’s a compact map:

This pack should let any agent drop into your flow, reduce uncertainty immediately, and move the needle with minimal supervision. If you want me to tailor any prompt template to a specific upcoming milestone (e.g., EVT build, seed round, creator toolkit), say the word and I’ll shape it for that context.
