## Quick Start
- Paste this prompt, fill placeholders, and require a short plan first.
- Method: Diagnose → Instrument → Plan → Implement → Verify → Document → Next steps.
- Deliverables: minimal diffs, evidence (logs/tests), crisp summary, commit text.

## Inputs
- Code/asset refs: `{paths:lines}`
- Constraints: `{latency/memory/budget}`
- Success: `{measurable acceptance}`
- Risks/unknowns: `{list}`

## Expectations
- Propose a 3–6 step plan before changes.
- Add gated diagnostics; present before/after evidence.
- Minimize diffs; justify each change and keep reversible.
- Return commit message, risks, and next steps.

## Method
- Diagnose → Instrument → Plan → Implement → Verify → Document → Next steps

## Decomposition Checklist
- Clarify context: identify failing behavior in logs; list key metrics (e.g., BPM, ACF peaks, phase, confidence).
- Map to code paths: note where pipeline diverges from expectations.
- Inspect inputs: weights, filters, thresholds, windows, toggles.
- Ensure instrumentation: add low‑overhead logs behind runtime flags if missing.
- Plan intervention: reversible, minimal steps with rationale and rollback.
- Implement & verify: small, justified diffs; run exact tests/logs; update toggles and docs.
- Communicate findings: what changed, why, evidence, lessons, guardrails, next steps.

## Response Style
- Precision first: state outcomes and evidence up front.
- Progress narrative: explain hypotheses, experiments, and insights.
- Actionable references: exact file paths and lines; concrete commands.
- Low cognitive load: interpret data; highlight the one or two numbers that matter.
- Confident humility: clear assumptions and follow‑ups.

## Deliverables
- Updated code with minimal diffs and rationale.
- “Wearing‑the‑code” explanation with precise references and usage notes.
- Evidence: logs, screenshots, test results before/after.
- Mini roadmap: lessons, risks, and next steps.
- Commit message ready to paste.

## Templates
- See `Captains_Handbook/Commit_Message_Scaffold.md` and `Captains_Handbook/Diagnostic_First_Rubric.md`.

## Verification Checklist
- Short plan shared first
- Diagnostics added and evidence captured
- Minimal, reversible diffs with rationale
- Verification steps and results included
- Commit message prepared using scaffold
