// phase3_guards.h â€” Compile-time and light runtime guards for Phase 3
//
// PURPOSE
// - Encode key Phase 3 operating constraints as compile-time checks so that
//   inadvertent changes are caught at build time (fast feedback, no regressions).
// - Keep these guards in one place for easy review; include from a central header.
//
// SCOPE
// - LED geometry and strip parity (primary/secondary counts must match 160).
// - DSP bin layout stability (64 bins).
// - These asserts are cheap (compile-time) and impose no runtime cost.
